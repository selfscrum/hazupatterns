### What

Font Awesome has a big selection of items than can be used with hazu. The standard selection list doesn't show them all.

### Why

More flexibility in designating points and hazus.

### How
Enter the id of a hazu, the desired font awesome, and the parent invite code name in the form.
Note: the uploaded icon stays in the hazu icon cache of that tenant, so you have to do this procedure only once. So, if you want to use an icon on a point and you can't determine its ID, you can apply it to a hazu first, and then take it from there.
