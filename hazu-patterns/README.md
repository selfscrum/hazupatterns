# What

* First trial of creating a Hazu pattern language to make structure and content creation more efficient.

# Why

* Ambitious projects should not start without a clear set of options.

# Caveat

* Since I am still learning Hazu, solutions might not be optimal. Structured by kind. Maybe later I can change this to be structured by user role, to route at least end-users better to their goal.
